      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We at Bite Against Hunger Advocacy Organization (BAHAO) are committed to spreading awareness about our advocacy, Food Security for all. BAHAO is composed of diverse individuals all around the Philippines.<br><br>
        We have Nutritionists, Doctors, Nurses, and Dietitians on board with our mission. Currently, we do monthly outreach at communities in the Philippines where famine resides. We offer food supply to the community and health services such as check-ups.

      <h2>How We Started</h2>
      <p>
        BAHAO started as a simple advocacy group for our university project at University of Calciumcus. After university, we decided to expand this advocacy group since the problem was widespread and daunting.<br><br>
        Through out the years, BAHAO has conducted nearly 100 feeding programs. Majority of which was during COVID. Additionally, BAHAO has provided healthcare to nearly 19,000 Filipinos all over the Philippines!<br><br>
        Currently, BAHAO has 10 core members and over 600 volunteers all over the Philippines. We hope we can increase those numbers. Join us now at BAHAO!

    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <div class="who-content">
      <p>
        I, Rhys Tabique, the founder of Bite Against Hunger Advocacy Organization, founded BAHAO in July 2016 while getting my degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calciumcus. I graduated as the Valedictorian of our Batch.<br><br>
        After University, I became a doctor and spent most of my time in Africa where I saw how malnourishment/hunger killed thousands of people.
        This led me to expand my advocacy group further because I had even more inspiration to help get rid of malnourishment/hunger.<br><br>
        Over the years, the BAHAO community has expanded so much. I thank all of the volunteers who have made BAHAO possible.
